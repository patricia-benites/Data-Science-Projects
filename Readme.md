# Data Science Projects


This repo contains my pet projects in which I applied different Data Science techniques. 

## [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/patricia-benites/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/Fraud%20Detection)

* Trained a Machine Learning Model to detect financial fraud
* Performed EDA, including statistical analysis like Anova, Tukey's Test, and $X^2$ Test
* Used the Stratified Shuffle Split method  to deal with unbalanced data, and a Decision Tree Classifier to predict fraudulent transactions

### Repository Contents

    ├── Fraud Detection
    │   ├── financial_fraud_detection.ipynb <- ipython notebook containing the analysis
    │   ├── Fraud Detection.pdf             <- PDF contatining the Decision Tree Model

## [Recommender System](https://github.com/patricia-benites/Data_Science_Projects/tree/master/Recommender%20System)

* Built a recommender system applying the collaborative filtering technique in the MovieLens dataset. 
* Demonstrated the technique using tools like Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib
* Performed predictions and evaluate them using the MSE metric
